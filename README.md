# Typora APA Theme

A custom Typora theme designed for seamless academic writing using the APA style guide to simplify the academic writing process.

This theme allows you to write your articles in Markdown using [Typora](https://typora.io/) and effortlessly convert them to beautifully formatted APA style PDFs without worrying about formatting.

## Features

- APA style formatting for headings, paragraphs, tables, and figures.
- Compatible with Typora's built-in Markdown-to-PDF export feature.
- Easy-to-use, lightweight, and perfect for academic writing.

## Installation

1. Download the `typora-apa-theme.css` file from this repository.
2. Open Typora, and navigate to `Preferences > Appearance > Open Theme Folder`.
3. Copy the downloaded `typora-apa-theme.css` file into the opened folder.
4. Restart Typora, and select `typora-apa-theme` from the theme dropdown in `Preferences > Appearance`.

## Usage

Simply write your academic article using Markdown in Typora, following the APA style guide for structure and formatting. When you're ready to export your work to a PDF, go to `File > Export > PDF`.

## Limitations

Currently, the biggest limitation of this theme removing the text-indent from the abstract.

Another limitation is the inability to fetch Zotero references directly from within Typora. However, you can use Zotero's built-in citation features to manage your references separately and then insert the formatted citations into your Typora document.
